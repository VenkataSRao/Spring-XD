This will give how to set up kafka as a transport bus..
Setting up kafka in a clustered environment..

Setting on single node:
=====================

Step 1. Download the 0.8.2.0 release and un-tar it.
        tar -xzf kafka_2.10-0.8.2.0.tgz
          cd kafka_2.10-0.8.2.0
          
          After that go to config folder and set provide zookeeper details..
    
Step 2. Start the server ( Zoo keeper first then kafka )

         bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
         
         bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
         
Step 3: Create  Topic
          Creating a topic test
        bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic test
        
        See the created topic with below command
        
        bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper localhost:2181
        
Step 4: Send Messages

        Kafka comes with a command line client that will take input from a file or from standard input and send it out as
        messages to the Kafka cluster. By default each line will be sent as a separate message.
        Run the producer and then type a few messages into the console to send to the server.
        
        
        bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test 
        
        This is test message
        This is another test messages
        
  Step 5: Start Consumer
  
        Kafka also has a command line consumer that will dump out messages to standard output.
        
        
        bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic test --from-beginning
        
         This is test message
        This is another test messages
        
        
        If you have each of the above commands running in a different terminal then you should now be able to type messages into the 
        producer terminal and see them appear in the consumer terminal.
        
        
        
        Setting up multip broker Cluster:
