In Spring XD, a basic stream defines the ingestion of event driven data from a source to a sink 
that passes through any number of processors

Syntax:

stream create --name streamname --definition "StreamDefinition" -- deply

example:

xd:> stream create --name ticktock --definition "time | log" --deploy

by default the deploy property is true..
