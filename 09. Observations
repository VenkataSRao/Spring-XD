Found below observation while working with springxd

1. while using mqtt as source and sink with differenct topics, sink is not publishing messages to sink topic and instead it is
publishing in source topic..

2. When working wtih distributed environament, code( application program code ) need to copy to all clustered machines.. 
why because, containers will be deployed on different machines, so code need to copu on all machines to execute business
logic.
